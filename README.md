# KoruPHP

KoruPHP is a lightweight PHP framework inspired by modern frameworks but designed to stay simple and extendable. It ships with a minimal router and supports building apps with controllers, middleware, and services.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 -t public
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the "Hello from KoruPHP!" message.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` – framework source files.
- `public/` – entry point for web requests.
- `config/` – configuration files.
- `apps/` – place your applications here.

This repository currently contains a minimal skeleton and is open for further development.
